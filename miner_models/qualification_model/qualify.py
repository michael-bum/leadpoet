"""qualification_model — universal evidence-first qualification miner.

Validator entry point:
    qualify(icp: dict) -> list[CompanyOutput dict]

Returns up to MAX_LEADS_PER_ICP (5) CompanyOutput-shaped dicts per ICP,
sorted by internal `score_company` score descending (best first).

The implementation lives in `_model.py` (an async pipeline). This thin
adapter wraps it in the synchronous `qualify(icp)` signature the
validator harness expects, and maps each verified lead to a clean
CompanyOutput dict (stripping internal metadata).

Pipeline (identical for every ICP — no per-ICP hardcoding):
    1. DISCOVERY   — Exa news (date-bound, primary-source biased) + Sonar
                     exclusion-driven 3-pass
    2. EXTRACT     — Strict LLM intent-match filter on every candidate
    3. ANCHOR LOOKUP — Sonar resolves website / LinkedIn / description
    4. URL SEARCH  — Exa keyword bias (company-domain + press wires)
    5. VERIFY      — Production `verify_three_stage` (Sonar → SD → Sonar-pro)
    6. SCORE       — Production `score_company` for internal ranking
    7. SUBMIT      — Dedupe by company, keep top-5

Environment (auto-loaded from {repo_root}/.env if present):
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY     Sonar / verifier LLM calls
    EXA_API_KEY            Exa news + keyword search
    SCRAPINGDOG_API_KEY    Verifier Stage 2 scraping
