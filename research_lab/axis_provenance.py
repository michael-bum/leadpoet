"""Axis-A/B call provenance: the single auditable stage→emitter mapping.

trajectoryimprovements.md P11 (as amended by the 2026-07-02 cross-audit) and
v5 §8.3: ``call_emitter`` records whether the tool call *following* an LLM
call was emitted by the model (axis-A — teaches policy) or by pipeline code
(axis-B — the model classifies while code drives). The mapping is derived per
call from control-flow semantics, never hard-coded per stream:

* Fixed-order engine stages (planner / draft / repair / judge) — code always
  chooses the next call → ``"code"``.
* Source-inspection rounds — the model emits ``search`` / ``read_file`` /
  ``finish`` operations that choose the next tool call → ``"model"``.
* The in-container champion/candidate sourcing pipeline — axis-B *by
  construction* (v5 §8.3: "the champion pipeline is axis-B"); Stage-2 trains
  on these traces directly, so ``"code"`` is the plan-correct value unless a
  candidate runtime genuinely lets model output choose the next tool call.

``teacher_model_flag`` is likewise derived from the stage's role: judge/scorer
stages act as teachers over another model's output. P19 note: the flag says
"this call played a teacher role", not "this model is ToS-cleared for
distillation" — the provider-ToS inventory binds the latter when it exists.

Keep every stage this repo emits in ``STAGE_PROVENANCE``; a pinning test
(tests/test_axis_provenance.py) asserts each value so any change is a
deliberate, reviewed decision.
