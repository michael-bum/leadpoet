"""
ICP Set Generation Task

Generates new ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) sets for benchmark evaluation.
Runs daily at 12:00 AM UTC (midnight UTC).

CRITICAL DESIGN:
1. ICPs are generated RANDOMLY but held CONSTANT until next reset
2. ICPs are stored PRIVATELY in qualification_private_icp_sets
3. Miners NEVER see the ICPs until evaluation time
4. ICP hash is logged to transparency_log for verifiability

GENERATION PROCESS:
1. Generate 20 ICPs — one per industry across 20 distinct industries
2. Use LLM to create realistic, varied prompts
3. Compute ICP set hash
4. Store in database
5. Log to transparency_log
6. Activate the new set

COMPANY-MODE ONLY (May 2026+):
The qualification model competition is single-path company-mode. Models
return a CompanyOutput keyed off industry / sub-industry / size / geography
/ stage / intent_signals. ICP prompts no longer carry target_roles or
target_seniority — anything role-shaped is legacy from the contact-mode
era and is intentionally absent from generated sets.

    system_prompt = """You are generating B2B sales-targeting ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles) for a benchmark. You have real-time web access — USE IT.

YOUR JOB
Generate exactly 20 ICPs, one per industry from the distribution list. Each ICP must describe a real, currently-existing target market that a salesperson could actually go prospect.

THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS MOST — REALISM
Before outputting any ICP, mentally verify: "Can I name at least ONE real, currently-operating company that satisfies ALL the criteria of this ICP — with verifiable recent activity matching the intent signal?"

If you cannot name a specific real company that fits, the ICP is INVALID. Broaden one of the constraints (geography, stage, employee band, sub-industry) until you CAN name at least one real company. Do not output an unrealistic combination under any circumstances.

To enforce this, every ICP MUST include a `verified_example_company` field naming the real company you found while verifying. This is not optional. If you cannot fill this field with a real company, you must rewrite the ICP with broader constraints until you can.

DO NOT generate ICPs where:
- The industry × stage × geography intersection has zero real companies you can name
- The intent signal doesn't fit the industry shape (Consulting firms don't "launch products"; Industrial Manufacturers don't have SaaS-style product launches; Real Estate firms do deals, not product launches)
- The stage doesn't match the intent (Seed companies don't acquire other companies; Series A startups don't make big-name strategic partnerships)
- The geography is so narrow that no real candidates exist
- The product/service is so specific that the buyer's universe collapses (use broad categories, not single named tools)

PROMPT VOICE
Each ICP's `prompt` field should sound like a different real salesperson typed it. Mix tones across the 20 prompts:
- Direct first-person ("I need", "I'm looking for")
- Casual ("yo can you pull", "hey, gonna need")
- Shorthand / telegraphic
- Question format ("what AI companies in...", "anyone tracking...")
- Descriptive / detailed ("Searching for...")

Never use job titles, seniority levels, "decision-makers", "executives", or any contact-level descriptor. Company-only.

CONSTRAINT LISTS (use ONLY these values)

ALLOWED INDUSTRIES (exactly one ICP per industry, in this order):
Software, Information Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Hardware, Data and Analytics, Privacy and Security, Health Care, Biotechnology, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Payments, Manufacturing, Commerce and Shopping, Professional Services, Advertising, Sales and Marketing, Real Estate, Energy, Education, Transportation

ALLOWED INTENT SIGNALS (pick 1-2 per ICP; pair naturally with the industry):
- Recently raised funding
- Just closed a round
- Launched or announced a new product
- Expanded to new markets
- Acquired another company
- Recent leadership change
- Achieved regulatory clearance or certification
- Announced a strategic partnership
- Hiring for senior engineering or sales roles
- Recent factory / facility / store opening

ALLOWED COMPANY STAGES: Seed, Series A, Series B, Series C+, Private Equity, Public

STAGE DISTRIBUTION — SPREAD EVENLY ACROSS STAGES:
The benchmark needs to test miner performance at ALL stages, not just late-stage companies. Skewing toward Series C+/Public (because those have the most PR coverage) makes the benchmark too easy and fails to test the harder verification cases.

Target distribution across the 20 ICPs (approximate, ±2 per bucket is fine):
- Seed: 2-3 ICPs
- Series A: 4-5 ICPs
- Series B: 4-5 ICPs
- Series C+: 3-4 ICPs
- Private Equity: 1-2 ICPs
- Public: 2-3 ICPs

Do NOT cluster on later stages just because they're easier to verify. The realism rule still applies (every ICP must have a real `verified_example_company`), but Seed and Series A startups exist with verifiable funding announcements — find them.

ALLOWED EMPLOYEE BANDS: 10-50, 50-200, 200-500, 500-1000, 1000-5000, 5000+
(Prefer 50-500 or 200-1000 for broader coverage.)

ALLOWED GEOGRAPHIES — STRONGLY PREFER BROAD VALUES:
- "United States" (whole country — use this for ~50% of ICPs)
- "United States, West Coast" / "Northeast" / "Midwest" / "South" / "Southwest" (use for ~40%)
- "United States, <State>" only when the industry has a known concentration there (~10%)
- "United Arab Emirates, Dubai" or "United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi" — at most 1 ICP, only when financial services / lending naturally fits

INDUSTRY × INTENT PAIRING (Sonar should naturally honor these):
- Service industries (Consulting, Legal, Accounting, Recruiting) → leadership change, hiring, expansion, acquisition, partnership — NOT product launch
- Real Estate / Commercial Real Estate / PropTech → acquisition, expansion, leadership change, funding, facility opening — NOT product launch
- Industrial Manufacturing → acquisition, expansion, partnership, facility opening, hiring — NOT SaaS-style product launches
- Tech / SaaS / AI / Hardware / Biotech / Payments / FinTech / Cyber / Health → all intents work
- Banking / large traditional finance → leadership change, acquisition, regulatory clearance, partnership

STAGE × INTENT PAIRING:
- "Acquired another company" → REQUIRES Series B or later
- "Announced a strategic partnership" → REQUIRES Series B or later
- "Recent factory / facility / store opening" → REQUIRES Series A or later
- All other intent × stage combinations are valid
