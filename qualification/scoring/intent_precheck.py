"""Intent pre-check — Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite semantic gate before Tier 2/3.

Tier 1.7 of the fulfillment scoring pipeline.  Runs AFTER Tier 1.5
(deterministic + geo / sub-industry LLM gates) and BEFORE Tier 2 (Sonar +
Gemini company / required-attribute verification) and Tier 3 (three-stage
URL verifier).

For each (miner_signal, mapped_icp_signal) pair, asks Gemini:
  "Does the miner's claim semantically satisfy the target ICP signal,
   treating miner_source + miner_url as evidence for any venue qualifier?"

If ALL of a lead's signals fail the pre-check, the lead is rejected at
Tier 1.7 with ``failure_reason="intent_precheck_no_match"`` — saving the
~$0.05-0.30 of downstream Sonar/Gemini cost on a hopeless lead.  Signals
that individually fail are tagged so Tier 3 can skip the expensive
three-stage verifier on them (lead_scorer reads the parallel verdicts
list passed in via scoring.py).

Failure mode: fail-OPEN.  Any HTTP non-200 (after 429 retries), timeout,
unparseable response, or unexpected exception returns verdict=True for
that signal so the three-stage verifier — which is authoritative on URL
content — still gets a chance.  Failing-closed during a transient rate
limit would reject every lead in flight; that's worse than briefly
letting the cheap gate be a no-op.

Activated via the INTENT_PRECHECK_ENABLED env flag (default off).

A separate free deterministic URL-evidence-quality gate (no LLM cost) runs
INSIDE this module before the Gemini call, gated by
INTENT_URL_PREFILTER_ENABLED.  It catches the obvious bare-LinkedIn-
company-page class of bad URLs on every claim type (not just hiring/
funding), plus target-type-specific LinkedIn rules.  See
``_check_intent_url_evidence_quality`` below.

    "Unverifiable" means a LinkedIn URL that does NOT point at a specific
    dated event and therefore cannot substantively back any intent claim:

      1. Bare company profile: ``linkedin.com/company/<slug>``
         A static profile — no posts, no jobs, no news — useless as evidence.

      2. Generic company feed pages:
         ``linkedin.com/company/<slug>/{posts,life,people,insights}``
         These are aggregated feeds or generic listing pages — a claim
         about a specific dated event (e.g., a 2023-11-30 LinkedIn post)
         is not verifiable by clicking a feed URL, since the feed only
         surfaces recent items, may have moved older posts off the
         visible window, or the specific post may have been deleted.
         LinkedIn serves SPECIFIC posts at ``/posts/<id>`` or
         ``/feed/update/urn:li:activity:<id>`` (different path entirely)
         — those remain acceptable.  ``/company/<slug>/about`` is also
         acceptable — it shows static company info (industry, HQ, size,
         description, specialties) that CAN substantiate static-fact
         intent signals.

    Used as a deterministic pre-Tier-1.5 lead-level hard gate: if a miner
    included EVEN ONE such URL among the lead's intent evidence, the
    entire lead is rejected before any LLM call (Tier 1.5, Tier 1.7
    substance, Tier 2, Tier 3).  Stricter than the per-signal check —

    Runs two layers, both deterministic and zero-cost:

       - empty URL → reject
       - bare LinkedIn company page (``linkedin.com/company/<slug>``)
         → reject.  A bare company page is a static profile — no jobs,
         no posts, no event-specific evidence — so it cannot
         substantively back ANY intent claim, regardless of topic.
         Production audit (2026-05-21): 71% of intent URLs on the Mexican
         construction chain and 42% on the Spanish creatives chain were
         bare LinkedIn slugs masquerading as evidence.

    2) TARGET-TYPE-SPECIFIC LinkedIn rules (only when ``target_type`` is set)
       - HIRING target: require /jobs/* or /company/<slug>/jobs path;
         any other LinkedIn path lacks visible hiring evidence → reject.
       - FUNDING target: reject personal profiles (/in/<slug>) — a
         personal page doesn't substantiate company-level funding events.

    For any URL not caught by either layer, returns ``('pass', reason)`` so
    the LLM substance check downstream remains authoritative.

    Args:
        url: the miner's submitted URL for this signal.
        target_type: 'HIRING' | 'FUNDING' | None.  None disables the
                     target-specific layer; the universal layer always

_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Judge whether a miner's evidence directly satisfies a target intent signal.

INPUTS
  lead_company:      "{lead_company}"
  miner_claim:       "{miner_claim}"
  miner_source:      "{miner_source}"
  miner_url:         "{miner_url}"
  target_icp_signal: "{target_icp_signal}"

The target intent signal is about lead_company specifically. Judge the claim
relative to lead_company — not any other entity mentioned in the claim.

POLICY
  Answer "yes" only if ALL rules below are satisfied for THIS pair.
  Answer "no" if ANY rule rejects.

RULES
  1. DIRECT SUBSTANCE MATCH. The claim must directly state the fact the target
     asks for. Inference, implication, or extrapolation does NOT count. Phrases
     like "indicates potential for", "suggests interest in", "implies need for",
     "could mean", "likely uses" are inference — reject.

  2. SPECIFICITY. If the target names a specific value, category, or range, the
     claim must match it specifically. Examples of mismatches: "Series A" vs
     "Series B/C/D"; "$300M raised" alone (no series named) vs "Series B/C/D";
     "import activity" alone vs "import from Asia/Europe/LatAm specifically".

  3. NEGATION CONTRADICTS. A claim asserting the opposite or zero of what the
     target asks for is a reject. Examples: "0 open positions" vs "active job
     postings"; "no longer hiring" vs "actively hiring"; "404 page" / "job no
     longer open" vs "active listings".

  4. TOPIC MATCH. Claim and target must be about the same topic. Selling a
     product is NOT the same topic as hiring for that role. A CEO keynote is
     NOT the same topic as job postings.

  5. NO CROSS-LANGUAGE / CROSS-TITLE ALIASING. A role name in another language
     or a different job title is NOT a direct match unless the target explicitly
     allows the alias.

  6. RECENCY. If the target requires a time window ("within the last 6 months",
     "in the last 30 days"), the claim must mention an event that fits that
     window, or the miner_url/miner_source must clearly support it. Today's
     date is {today}; treat earlier-than-window claims as reject.

  7. VENUE QUALIFIER IS SATISFIED BY source/url, NOT by claim text. If the
     target names specific evidence venues (e.g., "on LinkedIn or job boards",
     "in a press release", "on the careers page", "on G2", "via Twitter"),
     judge venue from miner_source + miner_url — NOT by requiring the claim
     text to repeat the venue language. The miner is not expected to restate
     the venue in narrative form.

     Example (the only one needed):
       target:  "Hiring SDRs on LinkedIn or job boards"
       claim:   "Company is hiring SDRs"
       source:  "job_board"
       url:     "lever.co/acme/..."
       → yes (rule #1 satisfied by claim, rule #7 satisfied by source/url)

  8. SUBJECT/OBJECT DIRECTION (for lead_company). When the target describes
     an event happening TO the company (e.g., "secured/raised/received
     investment", "was acquired", "received funding"), lead_company must
     appear in the claim as the RECIPIENT / PASSIVE party.  If the claim
     shows lead_company as the ACTIVE party — performing the action onto
     someone else — REJECT, even if the same investment / acquisition
     keywords appear.

     Examples (lead_company = "Acme" in all):
       target: "Company secured strategic or corporate investment"
       claim:  "Acme acquired a majority stake in Y"           → no  (Acme is acquirer)
       claim:  "Acme invested in Y"                             → no  (Acme is investor)
       claim:  "Acme raised $50M Series B"                      → yes (Acme is recipient)
       claim:  "Acme received strategic investment from Z"       → yes (Acme is recipient)

       target: "Company was acquired in the past 12 months"
       claim:  "Acme acquired Y"                                → no  (Acme is acquirer, not acquired)
       claim:  "Acme was acquired by Z"                         → yes (Acme is target)

       target: "Company partnered with a major enterprise"
       claim:  "Acme signed partnership with Y, a Fortune 500"   → yes
       claim:  "Acme expanded partner network with 5 small firms" → no  (no major enterprise)

  9. WHEN AMBIGUOUS, REJECT. Strict mode: if you cannot map the claim onto
     the target unambiguously under rules 1-8, answer "no".

    rejected them anyway, see lead_scorer._score_single_intent_signal).

    Any OpenRouter error after retries returns True for that signal
    (fail-open) — the three-stage verifier remains authoritative.
